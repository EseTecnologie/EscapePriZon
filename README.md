# EscapePriZon

The player will play the role of a prisoner trying to escape from the prison by overcoming various obstacles such as surveillance cameras and guards. The prisoner will have to land the guards (with objects that he can find in the cells or from the landed guards), in order to get the tiles to be able to escape.
